# Ecommerce-SQL-Project
These are the 2 final projects that I have finished during my SQL courses. The 2 projects consist of a couple of requests that I might receive from the stakeholders related to the dataset.
The dataset I used was Google Analytics Dataset, especially eCommerce data from the Google Big Query platform. Thanks to these projects, I gained much more understanding of how to use SQL commands effectively and a strong mindset regarding how to solve the requests by breaking them down step by step.

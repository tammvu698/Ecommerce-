# Ecommerce-SQL-Project
This 2 final projects that I finished during my SQL courses. The 2 projects consists of couples of requests that I might receive from the stakeholders related to the dataset.
The dataset I used was Google Analytics Dataset, especially eccomerce data from Google Big Query platform. Thanks to these projects, I gained much more understanding how to use SQL commands effectively and strong mindset regarding how to solve the requests by breaking down step by step.
